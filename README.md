## Ideas for tile types
- Movement tiles
    - Pillar tiles (can move in any direction)
    - Hallway tile (can move in forward or backward direction)
    - L tile (like above, but directs to either left or right)
    - Deadend tile (lol have to go back Fortunato)
- Victory tile
    - Stairs (hooray can go back to carnival)
- Buff tile
    - Table of wine (increase your hitpoints)
    - Room with note (marks location of exit for you)
- Debuff tile
    - Skeleton tile (you see a skeleton wearing the same clothes as you)
